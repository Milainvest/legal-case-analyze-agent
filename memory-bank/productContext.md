# Product Context

## Problem Statement

*   Japanese law students studying in the US face challenges in quickly understanding complex legal cases and preparing for demanding classroom interactions like the Socratic method and Cold Calls. They need support in comprehending case details efficiently and practicing responses to potential questions. (Ref: docs/requirment_definition.md Section 1.1, 2.1, 2.2)

## Proposed Solution

*   The system will provide a web application featuring:
    *   An engine to search for legal cases and automatically generate structured reports (including summaries, Case Briefs, and Cold Call Q&A).
    *   An AI chat interface for interactive Q&A about the case report, deeper understanding, and Cold Call simulation.
    *   A database to store and manage case information for efficient retrieval. (Ref: docs/requirment_definition.md Section 1.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3)

## User Experience Goals

*   **Efficiency:** Enable users to grasp key case information quickly.
*   **Confidence:** Help users feel prepared for class discussions and Cold Calls.
*   **Clarity:** Support understanding of complex legal concepts and English terminology.
*   **Usability:** Provide an intuitive interface (2-panel layout), responsive design, accessibility (WCAG 2.1), dark mode, and customization options. (Ref: docs/requirment_definition.md Section 2.2, 3.4)

## Functional Overview

*   Users input a case name to search.
*   The system retrieves/scrapes case data, analyzes it, and generates a report.
*   The report is displayed on the left panel, including basic info, summary, Case Brief, and Cold Call prep.
*   Users interact with an AI chatbot on the right panel to ask questions about the report, simulate Cold Calls, or clarify legal terms.
*   Reports can be exported (PDF/Word). (Ref: docs/requirment_definition.md Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4)
