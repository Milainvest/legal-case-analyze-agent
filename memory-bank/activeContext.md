# Active Context

## Current Focus

*   Initializing the project Memory Bank based on `docs/requirment_definition.md`.
*   Planning the initial development steps for the MVP.

## Recent Changes

*   Created initial Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
*   Populated `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, and `systemPatterns.md` based on requirements.
*   Updated agent state definition (`state.py`).
*   Modified UI component (`ResearchCanvas.tsx`) for case name input, report display, sources display, and manual text input.
*   Restructured agent workflow (`agent.py`) with new nodes and conditional logic (using placeholders).
*   Created `docs/task.md` outlining remaining MVP development tasks.
*   Added dependencies (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`) to agent environment.
*   Created `known_cases.py` and `scraper.py` (with placeholder logic).
*   Implemented initial logic for `retrieve_case_node` in `agent.py` (Task 1).

## Next Steps

*   Update `progress.md`.
*   Begin implementing Task 2 from `docs/task.md`: Implement `analyze_case_node` Logic (LLM integration, prompt engineering).
*   Refine UI state management in `Main.tsx`.
*   Implement mechanism for resuming workflow after manual input.
*   Test the MVP flow.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Confirming the interpretation of requirements documented in the Memory Bank.
*   Prioritizing features for the MVP implementation.
*   Finalizing the detailed architecture for core components (e.g., AI prompt design, database schema).
*   **MVP Data Retrieval Strategy:** Decided on a hybrid approach for `retrieve_case_node`. It will first check if the `caseName` matches a predefined list (~20-30 cases) and attempt scraping. If not found or scrape fails, it will signal the UI to request manual text pasting from the user.
