    *   Case information database management. (Ref: docs/requirment_definition.md Section 1.2)
*   **Scope:** Initial focus on MVP features (basic search/report, simple chat, basic UI/security). Future extensions include visualization, deeper analysis, community features, etc. (Ref: docs/requirment_definition.md Section 6)
*   **Success Metrics:** Measured by user satisfaction (Cold Call prep usefulness), retention (MAU), growth rate, feature usage, technical performance (accuracy, response time, stability), and business metrics. (Ref: docs/requirment_definition.md Section 8)
