# Progress Tracker

## Current Status

*   Project initialization phase. Memory Bank setup is complete based on initial requirements (`docs/requirment_definition.md`).
*   Currently in ACT MODE, implementing structural changes and fixing runtime errors for the MVP.

## What Works

*   Memory Bank structure established and populated based on initial requirements.
*   UI (`ResearchCanvas.tsx`) adapted for case name input, report display, sources display, and manual text input placeholder.
*   Agent state definition (`state.py`) updated for the case analysis task.
*   Agent workflow (`agent.py`) restructured with new nodes and flow (placeholder logic).
*   UI dependencies installed.
*   Created task breakdown document (`docs/task.md`).
*   Implemented initial `retrieve_case_node` logic (Task 1) including known case check, placeholder scraping, and manual input signaling.
*   Force reinstalled UI dependencies.
*   Implemented placeholder logic for `analyze_case_node` (Task 2) and `chat_node` (Task 4).
*   Confirmed workflow resumption logic (Task 7) relies on existing mechanisms.
*   Refined placeholder logic for `analyze_case_node` (Task 2) and `format_report_node` (Task 3).
*   Refined placeholder scraping logic (`scraper.py` - Task 1 refinement).
*   Refined placeholder chat logic (`chat_node` - Task 4 refinement).
*   Refined placeholder error handling logic (`handle_error_node` - Task 5 refinement).
*   Verified UI state management structure (`Main.tsx` - Task 6).
*   Implemented initial scraping logic for Justia & CourtListener URLs (`scraper.py` - Task 1 completion).
*   Refined placeholder logic for `analyze_case_node` (Task 2 refinement complete, including prompts and source tracking confirmation).
*   Reverted `server.py` to use CopilotKit runtime.
*   Refined placeholder chat logic (`chat_node` - Task 4 refinement complete).
*   Confirmed `copilotkit` dependency is listed in `pyproject.toml`.
*   Refined error handling within `analyze_case_node` (Task 2 refinement complete).
*   Corrected `copilot-runtime` import path and error message in `server.py` (removed sys.path hack).
*   Added `copilot-runtime` dependency to `pyproject.toml`.
*   Created `.env.local` file for UI API key.
*   Corrected import paths in agent files after directory rename.
*   Corrected `initialState` definition in `Main.tsx`.
*   Reverted agent ID in `Main.tsx` to `research_agent` to match `server.py`.
*   Added `<CopilotKit>` provider to UI layout (`layout.tsx`).
*   Corrected Q&A chain invocation in `analyze_case_node`.
*   Further refined Basic Info and Summary prompts in `analyze_case_node` (Task 2 refinement).
*   Added debug logging to `run_chain` helper in `analyze_case_node`.
*   Corrected state reset logic in `retrieve_case_node`.
*   Added "Analyze Case" button to `ResearchCanvas.tsx` to explicitly trigger workflow.
*   Successfully tested unknown case / manual input flow end-to-end.
*   Corrected LangGraph routing logic in `agent.py` (added `route_message_node`, fixed conditional edge).
*   Successfully tested chat routing logic end-to-end.
*   Fixed report display issue by adding `copilotkit_emit_state` in `format_report_node` (`agent.py`).

## What's Left to Build

*   **MVP Features (Ref: docs/requirment_definition.md Section 6.1):**
    *   Basic case search functionality.
    *   Basic report generation (core content: basic info, summary, Case Brief, Cold Call Q&A).
    *   Simple AI chat interface for report Q&A.
    *   Basic UI (2-panel layout).
    *   Initial database setup for storing case data.
    *   Basic security (user auth TBD for MVP scope).
    *   Basic error handling.
*   **Future Extensions (Ref: docs/requirment_definition.md Section 6.2):**
    *   Visualization, deeper analysis, community features, mobile app, etc.

## Known Issues & Bugs

*   Runtime errors encountered during initial testing (ModuleNotFound, missing UI API key, agent ID mismatch, Q&A prompt input) - Believed to be fixed.
*   Basic Info and Summary generation issues resolved in latest test.
*   Chat submission routing fixed. Chat responses are still placeholders.
*   Report display in UI textarea is now working after agent fix.

*(This file provides a snapshot of the project's completion status. Updated after fixing the report display issue.)*
