# Progress Tracker

## Current Status

*   Project initialization phase. Memory Bank setup is complete based on initial requirements (`docs/requirment_definition.md`).
*   Currently in ACT MODE, implementing structural changes for the MVP based on the agreed plan.

## What Works

*   Memory Bank structure established and populated based on initial requirements.
*   UI (`ResearchCanvas.tsx`) adapted for case name input, report display, sources display, and manual text input placeholder.
*   Agent state definition (`state.py`) updated for the case analysis task.
*   Agent workflow (`agent.py`) restructured with new nodes and flow (placeholder logic).
*   UI dependencies installed.
*   Created task breakdown document (`docs/task.md`).
*   Implemented initial `retrieve_case_node` logic (Task 1) including known case check, placeholder scraping, and manual input signaling.

## What's Left to Build

*   **MVP Features (Ref: docs/requirment_definition.md Section 6.1):**
    *   Basic case search functionality.
    *   Basic report generation (core content: basic info, summary, Case Brief, Cold Call Q&A).
    *   Simple AI chat interface for report Q&A.
    *   Basic UI (2-panel layout).
    *   Initial database setup for storing case data.
    *   Basic security (user auth TBD for MVP scope).
    *   Basic error handling.
*   **Future Extensions (Ref: docs/requirment_definition.md Section 6.2):**
    *   Visualization, deeper analysis, community features, mobile app, etc.
