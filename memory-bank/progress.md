# Progress Tracker

## Current Status

*   Project initialization phase. Memory Bank setup is complete based on initial requirements (`docs/requirment_definition.md`).
*   Currently in ACT MODE, fixing report generation errors and UI state persistence issues.

## What Works

*   Memory Bank structure established and populated based on initial requirements.
*   UI (`ResearchCanvas.tsx`) adapted for case name input, report display, sources display, and manual text input placeholder.
*   Agent state definition (`state.py`) updated for the case analysis task.
*   Agent workflow (`agent.py`) restructured with new nodes and flow (using `WriteReport` tool).
*   UI dependencies installed.
*   Created task breakdown document (`docs/task.md`).
*   Implemented initial `retrieve_case_node` logic (Task 1) including known case check, scraping, manual input signaling, and refined state reset logic.
*   Implemented `analyze_case_node` logic (Task 2) including section generation, instructing `WriteReport` tool call, improved JSON prompts, and error handling. Report state is updated directly in the node.
*   Implemented `chat_node` logic (Task 4) preserving report state.
*   Implemented basic error handling node (`handle_error_node` - Task 5).
*   Verified UI state management structure (`Main.tsx` - Task 6).
*   Implemented workflow resumption logic after manual input (Task 7).
*   Implemented scraping logic for Justia & CourtListener URLs (`scraper.py` - Task 1 completion).
*   Reverted `server.py` to use CopilotKit runtime.
*   Corrected `copilot-runtime` import path and dependency.
*   Created `.env.local` file for UI API key.
*   Corrected import paths in agent files after directory rename.
*   Corrected `initialState` definition in `Main.tsx`.
*   Added `<CopilotKit>` provider to UI layout (`layout.tsx`).
*   Added "Analyze Case" button to `ResearchCanvas.tsx`.
*   Successfully tested unknown case / manual input flow end-to-end (prior to recent refactoring).
*   Corrected LangGraph routing logic (`route_message` in `agent.py`).
*   Successfully tested chat routing logic end-to-end (prior to recent refactoring).
*   Report display in UI textarea is working (not appearing in Chat UI).

## What's Left to Build

*   **MVP Features (Ref: docs/requirment_definition.md Section 6.1):**
    *   Basic case search functionality.
    *   Basic report generation (core content: basic info, summary, Case Brief, Cold Call Q&A) - Needs testing after refactor.
    *   Simple AI chat interface for report Q&A - Needs testing after refactor.
    *   Basic UI (2-panel layout).
    *   Initial database setup for storing case data.
    *   Basic security (user auth TBD for MVP scope).
    *   Basic error handling - Needs testing after refactor.
*   **Future Extensions (Ref: docs/requirment_definition.md Section 6.2):**
    *   Visualization, deeper analysis, community features, mobile app, etc.

## Known Issues & Bugs

*   Runtime errors encountered during initial testing (ModuleNotFound, missing UI API key, agent ID mismatch, Q&A prompt input) - Believed to be fixed.
*   ~~Report generation skipped due to JSON parsing errors.~~ (Addressed by prompt/error handling changes - Needs Testing).
*   ~~Text area reset after suggestion generation.~~ (Addressed by `analyze_case_node` returning full state and `chat_node` preserving report - Needs Testing).
*   Unit/integration tests for agent nodes need to be implemented (Task 8).
